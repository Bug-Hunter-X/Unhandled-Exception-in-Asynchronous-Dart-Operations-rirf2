# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous programming: improper exception handling in `async` functions. The provided code snippet showcases an `async` function that fetches data.  It includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors during data fetching, however the rethrow mechanism is critical for appropriate error propagation and handling.

## The Problem

The problem lies in how exceptions are managed within the `async` function.  Without `rethrow`, exceptions caught within the `catch` block are silently handled, preventing higher-level error handling mechanisms from responding.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or applications crashing without providing meaningful information about the error.

## The Solution

The solution is simple: add the `rethrow` keyword in the `catch` block.  This ensures that the exception is re-thrown, allowing it to be caught at a higher level in the call stack where it can be appropriately logged, reported, or handled to prevent application crashes. The solution code showcases best practices for handling errors.
